# Predictive-Maintenance-in-Industrial-Systems-using-Machine-Learning

# Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of predictive maintenance techniques in industrial systems using machine learning. Predictive maintenance involves using data analysis techniques to predict when equipment failure is likely to occur so that maintenance can be performed just in time, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance model that can accurately predict equipment failures before they occur. By leveraging historical data on equipment usage, sensor readings, and maintenance records, the model aims to forecast potential failures and recommend maintenance actions proactively.

# Features
Utilizes machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance.
Supports data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
Provides visualization tools for data exploration and model evaluation.
Offers scalability for handling large datasets commonly found in industrial environments.
Includes documentation and examples for easy understanding and adoption.
